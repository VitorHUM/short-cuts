## 💡 Introduction

Game developed for "Project #1 - The Game" of the Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack São Paulo, class #85WDFT.
Inspired by the famous mobile game "Trivia Crack", our game consists of a quiz about shortcuts of the tools that we use in the course.
The game was made to help the students in the class.

## 🎮 The game

To start, the player enters his name and selects a difficulty, player lives and the difficulty of the questions vary according to the difficulty selected.
